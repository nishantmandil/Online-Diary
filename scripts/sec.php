            <p>Everybody has certain things they don't wish to share with others. That's why a secret diary is so
                important to many people. It gives you a safe place to go where you can write about anything from
                romances to future dreams. Since secret journals are intensely intimate, it's important that your
                privacy is protected. Keeping a diary in a physical notebook does not offer the security you need,

                secure? Fortunately, the digital age has made having such a diary much easier, though, as your
                journal can be protected with passwords, security questions, and more.</p>
