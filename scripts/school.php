                <p>Did you know that in the past, your mom or dad probably had a school diary? Yes, your parents! As weird
                    as that may sound to you, school diaries are nothing new. Although back then, school diaries lacked
                    creativity and were basically notebooks with blank covers. They also attracted snoopy little brothers
                    and sisters to open them and take a peek. At this point you're probably saying "ew" and "wow" and you're
                    right to do so. How boring right?</p>
                <br>
                <h1>School Diary Template</h1>
                <p>Luckily, you're living in a more technologically advanced time. And paper is, well, kind of phasing out.
                    Everything is done on tablets, smartphones and laptops. Think about it. When was the last time you
                    looked at your computer or smart device today? Chances are you're looking at one right now to read this,
                    and if you are, that's a good thing. If not, you're reading our thoughts and that's kind of cool!</p>
                <p>Anyway, back to diaries. If you're new to the school diary world, you may want to know how they look or
                    what you can put in them. A standard template for a school diary post will usually include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date of entry</li>
                    <li>Term or semester number</li>
                    <li>A place for your school name and your name</li>
                    <li>Post title or topic</li>
                    <li>Plenty of writing space</li>
                    <li>Tasks to take care of in the future</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Unlike printed diaries, which we agree are pretty "bleh", e diaries are much more customizable and some
                    have multiple categories pre-set for you. You can also upload photographs from your computer, smartphone
                    or tablet directly to your entries.</p>
                <br>
                <h1>School Diary Samples</h1>
                <p>A few journal examples for school diary posts are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Today Ms. Halford is totally springing that quiz on us! She said she wouldn't, but I guess I better
                        study tonight. Note to self: Study algebra (equations) tonight. Ace the pop quiz tomorrow!</li>
                    <li>I was sitting at the lunch table with Angela today and Allen cracked the dumbest joke in history.
                        Before I could start laughing, Angela sprayed milk all over the table. Note: Never tell Angela a
                        joke when she's drinking milk. (Insert picture of milk soaked Angela for future reference). It's
                        amazing just how much milk can come out of someone's nose!</li>
                </ul>
